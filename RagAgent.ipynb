    "A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by NVIDIA AI endpoints, LangChain, and FAISS vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete RAG pipeline that:\n",
    "- Loads and processes research papers from arXiv\n",
    "- Creates semantic embeddings using NVIDIA's embedding models\n",
    "- Stores documents in a FAISS vector database\n",
    "- Retrieves relevant context for user queries\n",
    "- Generates grounded, citation-backed responses using LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Uses semantic search to find the most relevant document chunks\n",
    "- **Context Reordering**: Applies long-context reordering to optimize retrieval quality\n",
    "- **Grounded Generation**: Responses are strictly based on retrieved documents\n",
    "- **Streaming Output**: Real-time response generation for better UX\n",
    "- **Production Ready**: Modular design for easy deployment and integration"
